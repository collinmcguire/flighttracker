# Flighttracker

Thank you for checking out my project, it is being created to learn more about working with APIs but to also be able track when a particular aircraft is flying. This is done by querying for the call-sign  of the aircraft and it will then notify when that aircraft is broadcasting ADS-B data. 

### Config data

In order to hide API keys I have created a config file in the parent directory the repository is cloned to. Below is the sample JSON that I used to create my config.

'''
{
  "APIKey" : "7152fe28d3mshb07d49c3a7848e8p1b32f1jsna3a09e4b1797",
  "host": "adsbexchange-com1.p.rapidapi.com"
}
